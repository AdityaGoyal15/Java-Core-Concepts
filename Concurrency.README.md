## Concurrency

Concurrency in Java refers to the ability of a Java program to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. It allows
different parts of a program to execute independently and concurrently, making efficient use of system resources, such
as CPU cores and memory. Java provides several concurrency concepts and constructs to support multithreaded
programming:

- **Thread**: A thread is the smallest unit of execution in a Java program. It represents a separate path of execution
  within a process. Threads can run concurrently, allowing multiple tasks to execute simultaneously. In Java, threads
  can be created by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface and passing it to a Thread
  constructor.
- **Thread States**: Threads in Java can be in different states, including NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING,
  TIMED_WAITING, and TERMINATED. These states represent different stages of the thread lifecycle, from creation to
  termination.
- **Synchronization**: Synchronization is a mechanism used to control access to shared resources in a multithreaded
  environment. It prevents race conditions and data inconsistencies by allowing only one thread at a time to access
  critical sections of code or shared variables. In Java, synchronization can be achieved using the synchronized
  keyword, Lock interfaces from the java.util.concurrent package, or atomic classes from the java.util.concurrent.atomic
  package.
- **Volatile Variables**: The volatile keyword in Java is used to mark variables whose values may be modified by
  multiple threads simultaneously. It ensures that changes made to volatile variables are visible to all threads
  immediately and prevents compiler optimizations that could reorder or cache variable accesses.
- **Thread Safety**: Thread safety refers to the property of a class or method that guarantees correct behavior when
  accessed concurrently by multiple threads. Thread-safe classes and methods are designed to handle concurrent access
  gracefully and avoid race conditions and data corruption.
- **Atomic Operations**: Atomic operations are operations that are performed as a single, indivisible unit of execution.
  In Java, atomicity is provided by atomic classes such as AtomicInteger, AtomicLong, and AtomicReference from the
  java.util.concurrent.atomic package. These classes provide atomic read-modify-write operations without the need for
  explicit synchronization.
- **Thread Pools**: Thread pools are a collection of pre-initialized worker threads that can be used to execute tasks
  concurrently. They improve performance and resource management by reusing threads instead of creating new ones for
  each task. Java provides the Executor framework and classes like ThreadPoolExecutor and Executors for managing thread
  pools.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: Java provides a rich set of concurrency utilities in the java.util.concurrent package to
  simplify multithreaded programming. These utilities include locks, conditions, barriers, queues, semaphores, and
  concurrent data structures like ConcurrentHashMap and ConcurrentLinkedQueue.

Understanding these concurrency concepts and constructs is essential for writing correct, efficient, and scalable
multithreaded Java applications. Effective use of concurrency can improve performance, responsiveness, and resource
utilization in Java programs. However, it also introduces challenges such as synchronization overhead, race conditions,
and deadlock, which must be carefully managed to avoid concurrency issues.
