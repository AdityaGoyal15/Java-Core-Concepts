## Abstraction

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves simplifying complex systems by
focusing on the essential aspects and hiding unnecessary details. It allows developers to model real-world entities or
concepts in a software system using classes, interfaces, and methods, without specifying the implementation details.

Here's a detailed explanation of abstraction with an example:

### Example: Vehicle Abstraction

Suppose we are developing a software system to manage various types of vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, and trucks.
We want to represent these vehicles in our system using object-oriented principles, with a focus on abstraction.

**Step 1: Identify Common Characteristics**

The first step in abstraction is to identify the common characteristics or properties shared by all types of vehicles.
These may include attributes like manufacturer, model, color, year, and methods like start(), stop(), accelerate(), and
brake().

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    void start();

    void stop();

    void accelerate();

    void brake();
}
```

In this example, we define a Vehicle interface with abstract methods representing common behaviors of all vehicles.

**Step 2: Implement Specific Vehicle Types**

Next, we implement specific types of vehicles by creating concrete classes that implement the Vehicle interface. Each
class provides its own implementation for the methods defined in the interface, according to the behavior of the
specific vehicle type.

```java
public class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Car started");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Car stopped");
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Car accelerating");
    }

    @Override
    public void brake() {
        System.out.println("Car braking");
    }
}

public class Motorcycle implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle started");
    }

    @Override
    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle stopped");
    }

    @Override
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle accelerating");
    }

    @Override
    public void brake() {
        System.out.println("Motorcycle braking");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have implemented two specific types of vehicles: Car and Motorcycle, each providing its own
implementation of the Vehicle interface methods.

**Step 3: Use Abstraction to Interact with Vehicles**

Finally, we can use abstraction to interact with vehicles in a generic way, without knowing the specific details of each
vehicle type. We can create objects of the Car and Motorcycle classes and treat them as instances of the Vehicle
interface.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = new Car();
        Vehicle motorcycle = new Motorcycle();

        car.start();
        car.accelerate();
        car.brake();
        car.stop();

        motorcycle.start();
        motorcycle.accelerate();
        motorcycle.brake();
        motorcycle.stop();
    }
}
```

In this example, we create objects of the Car and Motorcycle classes and assign them to variables of type Vehicle. We
then call the common methods defined in the Vehicle interface (start(), accelerate(), brake(), stop()) on these objects
without knowing their specific types.

### Benefits of Abstraction

- **Simplification**: Abstraction allows us to focus on essential aspects of a system while hiding unnecessary details,
  leading to simpler and more manageable code.
- **Reusability**: By defining common interfaces and behaviors, abstraction promotes code reuse across different parts
  of a software system.
- **Flexibility**: Abstraction provides a flexible framework that can accommodate changes and extensions to the system
  without affecting its overall structure.

Overall, abstraction is a powerful concept in object-oriented programming that enables developers to model complex
systems in a clear, modular, and maintainable way. It promotes code organization, reusability, and flexibility, making
it an essential aspect of software design.
