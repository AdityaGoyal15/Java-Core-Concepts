## Object-oriented programming (OOP)

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data (
attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). OOP focuses on organizing code into modular units (objects)
that represent real-world entities or concepts. It encourages the use of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and
polymorphism to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Key principles of object-oriented programming include:

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling only the relevant aspects and
  hiding unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through the creation of classes and interfaces, which
  define the structure and behavior of objects without specifying implementation details.

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (behavior or
  functionality) within a single unit (object). It restricts access to the internal state of an object and only exposes
  the necessary interfaces for interacting with it. Encapsulation helps in achieving data hiding, modularity, and
  information hiding.

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and
  behavior from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and supports the creation of
  hierarchies of classes with specialized functionality. Subclasses can override or extend inherited methods and
  properties to provide custom behavior.

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms and behave differently based on
  their types or classes. It allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface.
  Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time
  polymorphism).

Object-oriented programming languages, such as Java, C++, Python, and C#, provide built-in support for implementing OOP
concepts. These languages offer syntax and features for defining classes, creating objects, implementing inheritance,
and achieving polymorphism. OOP promotes code organization, reusability, and maintainability by encouraging the use of
modular, object-oriented design principles.

Overall, object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm for designing and implementing software systems by modeling
real-world entities as objects and defining their interactions through encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It
fosters code modularity, flexibility, and scalability, making it widely used in the development of complex software
applications.
