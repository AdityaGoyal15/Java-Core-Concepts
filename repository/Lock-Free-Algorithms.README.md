## Lock-free Algorithms

Lock-free algorithms are concurrency control techniques used in multi-threaded programming to manage shared resources
without the use of traditional locks or mutexes. Instead of blocking threads when accessing a shared resource, lock-free
algorithms allow multiple threads to progress independently without contention, even in the presence of concurrent
updates.

There are two main categories of lock-free algorithms:

- **Wait-Free Algorithms**:
  In a wait-free algorithm, every thread is guaranteed to make progress within a finite number of steps, regardless of
  the behavior of other threads. This means that no thread can be blocked indefinitely. Wait-free algorithms ensure that
  every thread can complete its operation even if other threads fail, making them highly resilient in highly concurrent
  environments.

- **Obstruction-Free Algorithms**:
  In an obstruction-free algorithm, each thread is guaranteed to make progress if it operates without contention from
  other threads. However, if there is contention, the progress of a thread may be delayed temporarily. Unlike wait-free
  algorithms, obstruction-free algorithms do not guarantee progress within a finite number of steps, but they provide
  progress guarantees under certain conditions, making them suitable for scenarios with moderate contention.

**Lock-free algorithms often use atomic operations, compare-and-swap (CAS) operations, or other low-level concurrency
primitives provided by hardware or software platforms. These operations ensure that updates to shared variables are
performed atomically without requiring explicit locks.**

**Examples of lock-free algorithms include lock-free linked lists, lock-free queues, and lock-free stacks. These data
structures use atomic operations to manage concurrent access without the need for global locks, allowing multiple
threads to perform insertions, deletions, and other operations concurrently.**

Lock-free algorithms are preferred in high-performance, highly concurrent systems where scalability and responsiveness
are critical. However, designing and implementing lock-free algorithms can be challenging due to the complexity of
concurrency control and the need to ensure correctness and consistency in the presence of concurrent updates. As such,
lock-free algorithms are typically used in specialized scenarios where the benefits outweigh the complexity of their
implementation.
